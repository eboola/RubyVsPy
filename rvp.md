Hi guys, today I will be showing you the difference between Python and Ruby.  
Both of these languages are **object oriented**, meaning that almost EVERYTHING is an object.  
# Test 1 - Readability
Alright: Here is test one - readability.  
## Part 1 - Writing a message
Ruby:  
```
puts "Hello World!"
```
Not bad. Let's see python!  
Python:  
```
print("Hello World")
```
This one: I think **Ruby** deserves a point.
